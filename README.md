 # Each size displays first page when difficulty level will be asked and when someone selects that, question will appear on screen instantly.
 # when someone will click on the answer, the color will change to green #DDFEC0 as shown in the mockup
 # Correct or false will appear as shown.Color = #06821B
 # There will be option for next button with background color green #DDFEC0.

 # Report:
 # Steps taken
 # First, I crafted the basic structure of the prototype using HTML. This involved creating sections for the header, difficulty selection, questions, and footer to ensure clarity and user-friendliness.
 
 # Next, I enhanced the visual appeal by applying styles with CSS.  Utilizing colors, fonts, and layout techniques, I aimed to make the  prototype visually pleasing and adaptable to various screen sizes.
 
 # Afterwards, I implemented interactive functionality using JavaScript. Users can now select a difficulty level, view questions, choose answers, and receive instant feedback on correctness.

# However, the JavaScript implementation is still in progress. While users  can interact with the difficulty buttons and see questions, the logic for   checking answers and proceeding to the next question is yet to be completed.

# Challenges:
# Styling the webpage with CSS was challenging. One of the tricky parts was ensuring that it looked good on different web browsers. Sometimes, the styles didn't display the same way on all browsers, so I had to make adjustments to ensure consistency. Additionally, making the webpage responsive to different screen sizes was tough. I had to ensure that the layout and elements scaled properly on both small and large screens.
# styling the webpage with CSS required patience, attention to detail, and thorough testing to achieve the desired appearance and functionality.

# Resources:
# Throughout the development process, I relied on valuable resources such as IMD Docs, and W3Schools. These platforms provided guidance on various aspects of web development and assisted me in problem-solving.
